# ChatBot

![Documentation Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-latest-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)

A chatbot developed for CSI-VIT's member's application. Currently, under active development.

The intention is that the ChatBot serves as an assistant for the users, allowing them to ask questions (possibly in a conversational manner) and get answers.
